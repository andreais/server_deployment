# TCP server and client to send texts
this project was made to learn sockets with C. it's a simple TCP server and client to send message, and get the message's length back.

## why is the code commented that much ?
i added the most comments possible to keep a trace of what i was doing, and also to know what headers to use and what do they specifically have.
